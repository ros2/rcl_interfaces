# lifecycle_msgs
This package contains message and service definitions for managing lifecycle nodes.
These messages and services form a standardized interface for transitioning these
managed nodes through a known state-machine.

For more information about life cycle nodes see: [design.ros2.org](http://design.ros2.org/articles/node_lifecycle.html).
